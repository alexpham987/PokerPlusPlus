If you guys are having trouble compiling with the makefile and gtkmm, try this:

open terminal, do not change the directory 
Download pkg config : sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config
Download gtkmm : sudo apt-get install libgtkmm-3.0-dev

After this, you should be able to compile everything. You should be able to run the executable and get a window to pop up when you do.
